# The Vega token website

This project was initially a separate repo that has been integrated and improved into the frontend monorepo.

You can go to the new shiny [monorepo](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/frontend-monorepo) to track development and contribute. At the time of writing it is located at `apps/token`.
