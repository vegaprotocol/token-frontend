# üõë STOP üõë

Before you file this bug please ensure that this is a **front end** bug. Go through the following checklist:

1. Ropsten is functional, [click here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) and make sure the last block was less than 1 min ago otherwise it indicates Ropsten issues. Please retest when Ropsten is stable.
2. The network you are testing on is stable [click here](https://stats.vega.trading/) and make sure block times are less than 2 seconds and the status is connected. Please retest when stable in if not.
3. You have made your best effort at validating that the core data is correct and the behaviour is not intended in terms of the Vega Protocol or Smart Contracts. You can use the [devnet](https://n04.d.vega.xyz/playground), [stagnet](https://n03.s.vega.xyz/playground) and [testnet](https://n06.testnet.vega.xyz/playground) GraphQl playgrounds to do so for the core side. You can also use [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/) to check functions are returning different values to what you are seeing in smart contracts.
4. Make sure you have tried with the latest version of go-wallet

If you are certain everything is as it should be above then please complete the below:
